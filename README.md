Use NFTs from opensea as a key of some sort in DCL

Check to see if user has this nft in their wallet: 
https://opensea.io/assets/0xe39a238d74bdd95a895026fc25ec97fb8a4b1959/37

If user has that nft in their wallet console.log (Approved)
Or else console.log (not approved)

Please include comments for each section of code so it will be easier for me to understand whats going on

It would be nice if the coin could rotate if the user had the NFT...but not required

Ideally i would want to use this code to give certain perks to my NFT holders in Decentrland.
